        <p>
          In collaboration with the University of Southern California, I
          assisted an on-going study, <em>Golf for Healthy Aging</em>. Primarily
          working on data analysis, I created, manipulated, and visualized new
          findings using various different tools in <em>python</em>. This paper
          regarding this project has been published.

        <p>
          Match Mania is a <em>Java-based</em> card matching game specifically designed
          for Android devices. Its objective is to match all the cards with the
          fewest number of attempts possible. The game was developed as part of
          my application development course, and it incorporates Firebase for
          storing and retrieving user scores, as well as implementing a
          convenient login system for players.

        <h3>Data Analysis and Cleaning in Python</h3>
        <p>
          A group project for Programming Languages. Given a dataset of over
          half a million recorded accidents, we were tasked to read, clean, and
          handle routine errors. Importing pandas for data analysis /
          manipulation, our group managed the fastest time when cleaning, an
          filtering data when querying for information.

        <h3>Max One's Genetic Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
          A genetic algorithm that uses tournament selection to favor rows of a
          2D array with a greater amount of 1's. The goal is to, over
          generations, 'breed' rows with a higher concentration of 1's
          ultimately resulting in a row with 20 total 1's.
